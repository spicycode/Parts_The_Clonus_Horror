# Parts: The Clonus Horror

So you see I'm lazy and don't want to read 4,000,000,000,000 RSS messages telling me who committed what.  I also like to carry my code around with me.   You never know when the mood will strike you and having tons of code with you might be a good thing.   

This script, is a small little piece of code that takes a simple YAML file (see mine, which is included as a starter) and grabs all the repos defined in it.

You can run it subsequently to do all manner of foul magic.

# Setup

* Fork it/Clone it/Download it, whatever
* bundle install
* Edit the_clonus_horrors.yml until you are content.  It has a few of the repos I carry around with me in it to get you started.  Your brain could not stand the awesome fighting force that is my full the_clonus_horrors.yml file.

# First Run
* Run ./parts
** All your repos are cloned, if they already exist nothing is done

# Second through Infinity Run
* ./parts git update or ./parts ls or ./parts my-hands-are-bananas
** You get the idea
