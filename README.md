# Parts: The Clonus Horror

So you see I'm lazy and don't want to read 4,000,000,000,000 RSS messages telling me who committed what.  I also like to carry my code around with me.   You never know when the mood will strike you and having tons of code with you might be a good thing.   

This script, is a small little piece of code that takes a simple YAML file (see mine, which is included as a starter) and grabs all the repos defined in it.

You can run it subsequently to do all manner of foul magic.
